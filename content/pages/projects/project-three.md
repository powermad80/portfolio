An artist on Patreon whom I was acquainted with had a dilemma - one of the rewards he offered his patrons that made him successful - a colored sketch commission per patron each month - was also a significant drain on his time and resources. This led him to set a limit on the number of people who could be entitled to this reward, easily done through setting a limit on the respective Patreon reward tier. His popularity, however, led these limited tier slots to become so sought after that they often traded hands in private arrangements negotiated online within his established clique, reducing his ability to properly be accessible and visible to new fans.

To meet this issue, I designed this website to allow anyone to subscribe to a mailing list, which thanks to integration with Patreon's API and webhooks, would alert anyone on the list when there suddenly became an available slot in the Patreon tier that they were interested in. I collaborated with the artist on visual design as well as the basic feature set and behavior for subscription emails.

Sadly, this website never made it to full deployment, as discussion on hosting, deployment, and payment were interrupted by the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, the site remains in my portfolio, a complete product that might've even seen the light of production in another, better timeline.

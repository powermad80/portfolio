  I take care of this sweet little noodle. Her name is Raven and she's a ball
  python. She's still a small baby snake but someday she'll grow up into large
  and long lady and take up quite a lot of space, even though I still won't be
  able to charge her for rent

Raven is a ball python. She's small, but may one day be quite large. She enjoys swallowing whole rats, adult mice that smell like rats, rocks placed under a heat lamp, and crawling between the hands and arms of me and my friends like they're soft warm tree branches.

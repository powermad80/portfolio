  Started life as a Python project, ported to C#. Simple GUI for saving and
  hot-swapping between different versions of the contents of a directory that
  changes often, intended for use in managing video game save files.

Made to solve a simple problem - many PC games are not good at providing tools to manage many save data files. Many don't even offer any control at all, keeping the file and its management hidden. As a gaming college student I had a simple desire, in the game Undertale, I enjoyed many of the shoot-em-up fights that happen at just a few portions of the game, depending on the route taken. I enjoyed replaying them and returning to previous ones at times, but you could only keep a handful of save files at a time. So I created this program to let me open up a small window, select a save file called "Before Undyne" or "Asgore Fight" and launch the game, immediately set at a saved checkpoint right at the labeled location. Then when finished restore back to the save file I had previously been using.
